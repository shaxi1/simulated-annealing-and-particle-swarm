# SA and PSO algorithms
Following project is an implementation of Simulated Annealing [SA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing) 
and Particle Swarm [PSO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_swarm_optimization) optimization algorithms in Java.
</br></br>
# Features and used libraries
Program uses [Math Parser](https://mathparser.org/) to take custom functions to optimize as an input from the user. It is also possible
to use some predefined [test functions for optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_functions_for_optimization).
</br>
Optimization of custom functions is visualized with the usage of [matplotlib4j](https://github.com/sh0nk/matplotlib4j)
